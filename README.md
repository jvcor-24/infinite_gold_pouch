# infinite_gold_pouch

In this repository, I create a Python code to solve the riddle describe in the following video:

[This one weird trick will get you infinite gold - Dan Finkel by TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgvmJTmJIKs&t=1s)

This is used as a learning example for learning Python programming.
